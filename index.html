            <p>In 2012, I wrote my undergrad thesis on Electric Cars. Based on my year of research, I said we weren't yet ready for a mass-market electric-vehicle; We lacked the charging infrastructure and the financials of the battery technology simply didn't make sense yet. <br>
                <br> So with EV's off the table, I graduated and began my career as a seasonal outdoor-professional. <br>
                <br> I worked as a wilderness guide in the summer, taught Environmental Ed in the Fall and Spring, and worked as a Snowboard instructor in the winter. Life was good. <br>
                <br> But in 2018, 6 years after I wrote my thesis, Tesla began delivering the Model 3. While I was playing in the woods, they had taken every penny earned and invested it in a national charging infrastructure that would allow you to drive their cars from coast-to-coast.<br>
                <br> And they had brought the price-per-KwH down dramatically by bringing battery production to scale with their Nevada Gigafactory, making a $35k electric car within reach.<br>
                <br> They had overcome the two major roadblocks I had identified back in 2012.<br>
                <br> While I loved working for non-profits and inspiring future generations to be good land-stewards, I donâ€™t think there is a company doing more for the planet in the here-and-now than Tesla. So I applied for a job.<br>
                <br> So now I'm a greasy car-salesman. Hopefully with a little less grease ;) </p>
